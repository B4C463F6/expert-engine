AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. It was introduced in November 2014.[1]

Node.js, Python, Java, Go,Ruby, and C# (through .NET) are all officially supported as of 2018. In late 2018, custom runtime support was added to AWS Lambda.
